# Travelbuzz2

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.9.
The idea for travelbuzz was to create an application that makes it easy for 
client to plan trips. Travelbuzz offers Travelnews, Vaction rentals, Fodors travel, Zagat travel, and Best thing I ever ate. On the home page I wanted to 
provide a list of hotels as you enter in your destination, but my api does not 
work. The Bucket list is a list of Adventure that you would like to do. Enter
in your level of interest and go for your adventure!


## Development server
